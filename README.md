## Analysis for Potential Bitcoin Arbitrage

The purpose of this project is to sort through historical trade data for Bitcoin on the Bitstamp and Coinbase exchanges. I will collect, prepare, and analyze data to determine if there were arbitrage opportunities for Bitcoin during the specified time period. 

## Technologies

This project with be built in a Jupyter notebook. I'll use the Path module from the pathlib library as well as the Pandas library. 

## Installation Guide

The crytpo_arbitrage.ipynb Jupyter notebook contains data from (2) CSV files: bitstamp.csv and coinbase.csv. Each file contains information on Bitcoin from 1/1/2018 through 3/31/2018. Each date in the files has Bitcoin price information that was taken in 1-minute intervals. 

## Usage

The cells in the notebook have been fully executed. All of the analysis with supporting statistics and plots are ready for review.
